## Questions

### What is the **main research question/goal**? _(there may be more than one, but usually there is an overarching research question/goal.)_

- They are the first to conduct a study to understand the test automation culture in Android and Microsoft app development community.
- They analyze the extent to which Android apps are adequately tested by checking the presence of test cases and calculating coverage.
- They survey many Android and Microsoft app developers and collect their responses to understand testing tools used by them and challenges faced by these developers in testing their applications.

Research Questions:
- RQ1: Are Android applications well tested?
- RQ2: Do Android developers use automated testing tools to test their applications? What are the tools commonly used by Android developers and the challenges faced by them while testing their applications?
- RQ3: Do Microsoft developers use automated testing tools to test their applications? What are the tools commonly used by Microsoft developers and the challenges faced by them while testing their applications?

### Why is this paper **important**?

Despite the growing interest in the software testing and reliability research community to build tools that can automate and improve testing of mobile apps, there has been no study that investigates how developers test these applications in practice. This study is needed to understand the “pain points” that these developers face which can be used to motivate future research that addresses concerns that matters to mobile app developers.

### What is the **methodology** used to answer the research question(s) or reach the goal?

The study is divided into two parts:
- In the first one, they analyzed over 600 open-source Android apps to examine the current state of testing in the Android development community.
- In the second part, they replicated the above survey study with app developers from Microsoft. They improved their survey based on the responses of the first study and ask Microsoft developers about the type of testing they do, tools they use and the challenges they face during testing.

### What **data** does the paper use?

Part 1:
The dataset includes small apps to large and popular apps such as K- 9 Mail, FrostWire - Downloader/Player, OsmAnd Maps & Navigation and OI File Manager, which have more than 1,000,000 installs.

Part 2:
They surveyed over 600 developers and received 127 responses.

### If there is a **statistical model**, what is the product, behavior, or process being modeled? What are the key characteristics of the model?



### What are the **limitations** of using this methodology on the results?



### What is **the answer** to the research question? _(in case of a goal: What is the contribution of the paper towards that goal?)_



### What did you **not understand** of this paper?
