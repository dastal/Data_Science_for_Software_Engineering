# Paper reading worksheet

This document contains the questions to be answered when reading the papers that are going to be discussed in a discussion session of the course.

## Questions

### What is the **main research question/goal**? _(there may be more than one, but usually there is an overarching research question/goal.)_

But the main goal of this paper is to "observe how CI happens in the wild on a large basis of influential OSS projects."

### Why is this paper **important**?

Developers need to know the state of the art of how CI is done in the OSS community. Especially maintainers of and newcomers to CI,
whether they join an established project or plan to introduce CI, will benefit from knowing what they can expect from it.

### What is the **methodology** used to answer the research question(s) or reach the goal?



### What **data** does the paper use?

For the first research question trhey used the GHTORRENT database as a source of projects to examine and apply filtering to select the most appropriate ones. For the second and the third research question they filtered their recived the data set fropm TRAVIS CI and used just the Java and the Ruby projects because those two languages enjoy wide popularity among developers and have a strong testing tradition. After that they again filtered out the projects which did not use TRAVIS CI and kept only the ones which used it. Then they combined the both data sources in the newly implemented TRAVISTORRENT.

### If there is a **statistical model**, what is the product, behavior, or process being modeled? What are the key characteristics of the model?



6. What are the **limitations** of using this methodology on the results?
7. What is **the answer** to the research question? _(in case of a goal: What is the contribution of the paper towards that goal?)_
8. What did you **not understand** of this paper?
